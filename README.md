# Loyola at 150: Student Life Timeline
*Loyola at 150: Student Life Timeline is an open-access digital exhibit of key events in student life and institutional history at Loyola University Chicago and Mundelein College, along with significant world and Chicago events that occurred over the period of 1870-2020. The project was developed to celebrate Loyola's 150th anniversary, and the accomplishments and experiences of its alumni over the years.*

*The project was created using [Omeka S](https://omeka.org/s/), a content management site, and [TimelineJS](https://timeline.knightlab.com/), an open-source tool for creating timelines created by the Knight Lab at Northwestern University.*
